		{MESSAGE (Aire Reumario) (_"Could that be possible? Yes! Lorin! Long I was dreaming about repaying you for what you've done to my brother, Reumario, in Haeltin. Your time has come..")}
		{MSGLORINM (_"Oh my, I am scared. Haeltin? Let me think... Ah yes, I remember now. Your brother was probably that flabby lobbish wimp who was crying looking at my knife.")}
		{MSGGAWENM (_"Mother, it's enough we have four Akladian armies on our head. You do not have to make them even more furious.")}
		{MESSAGE (Aire Reumario) (_"And who is this niddering stripling, who think that by growing beard he can start to look as a man, who is hiding behind his mother back?")}
		{MSGLORINM (_"Gawen, he was talking to you. Aire, I think you have just sealed your fate.")}
		{MSGGAWENM (_"Aire Reumario, whatever my mother did to your brother, there is no need for you to behave like a lout. If you don't like me, fine, but show that with your sword, not with your mouth.")}
		{MSGLORINM (_" Heh, Heh, 'if you don't like me', Gawen, you are fabulous.")}

		{MSGLORINM (_"Different are the kinds of death, Aire the FEARLESS. Now, I want to introduce you to..")}
		{MSGGAWENM (_"Mother, put down that knife! This is an order.")}
		{MSGLORINM (_"What knife? Gawen, you are waaay to soft. They wouldn't be that merciful on us, if they would have chance to catch us.")}
		{MSGGAWENM (_"I don't care. Allow this man to die peacefully.")}
