			story=_"After Gawen's death I felt dead as well. Then Reme have left me and I was all alone. I couldn't go back to my family. They hated me, because I failed their hopes. They hated me, because I tried to be independent. And maybe they hated me because I was reminding them how I became wife of Gawen's father: how I became a queen."

			story=_"The other woman maybe would just give up. Maybe, if I would have different heart, I would just beg my father for admission into his castle. But I am Lorin. I took soldiers Reme gave me for my protection and I rode east. I knew people there, who could help me. Akladians would not fight for me, I was sure of that; So I had to find someone else who would.

			story=_"They were called Aragwaithi, which in their barbarian and unworthy language meant something like 'noble'. They were mercenaries offering their services to anyone. They were not race, though in past times their ancestors came here from distant lands. Now, they accepted everyone into their ranks. I've heard that even some Akladians found their place amongst them."
		[/part]
		[part]
			story=_"From all underlings in Wesnoth, they were those, who resisted us the most. In last battle, when all other Wesnothians were running for their life, Aragwaithi stood and fell to the last one. That's why we cutted their head off, their hands and legs, so in after life they could not be danger for us."
		[/part]
		[part]
			story=_"I found one of their sietches and talked to their leader, called Andrey Yaranov. I wanted swords, and I had gold; they had swords and wanted gold. So we struck the deal very fast. I felt uneasy amongst them, with their eyes, hair, faces screaming that they are underlings. But I told myself they are just swords; hired swords."
