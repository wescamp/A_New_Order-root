			story=_"Once there was a great city here, I was told. Once people were crowding on its streets, and its walls were reaching the sky. Now only ruins have remained - only the skeletons of buildings and empty wells."
		[/part]
		[part]
			story=_"It is said that Akladians were unable to take the Weldyn, they never were good in taking fortified cities. They sieged the city for years, storming the walls with ferocity and fanatical courage."
		[/part]
		[part]
			story=_"Finally they were helped by the treachery from the inside.  The traitor was promised three bags of gold for opening the city gates.  Akladians kept their promise. The tale has it that they tied the three bags of gold to traitor's legs before they push him from the walls into the river."
